# Surfboard

Surf the web using only your keyboard!

Programmers and Linux fans know it well that a Mouse can only slow you down. Not only this, mouse introduces an additional strain for elder and differently abled people who do not necessarily possess the motor skill to precisely operate a mouse. Keeping this in mind, Surfboard allows you to browse the web totally without your mouse. Surfboard can dramatically increase your browsing speeds and save time.

How to use:

1) Simply press CTRL+Space on any website to bring up a SurfBoard. You can see all clickable elements are now higlighted with a tag number.

2) Type in the tag number and hit enter! If you want to hide tags and Surfboard again, press CTRL+Space again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Future Goals:

1) Adding keywords to Surfboard which will open up sites.

2) TTS integration to Surfboard.

3) Using linux redshift-like techniques to implement dark mode on web pages.
